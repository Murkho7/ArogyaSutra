Existing MLLMs, predominantly trained on English-centric data, struggle to support such use cases, limiting equitable access to AI-driven healthcare assistance. To address this challenge, we construct a large-scale multilingual multimodal medical question–answer dataset from eight heterogeneous sources, covering 31 body systems, six imaging modalities, and 21 clinical domains across English and seven major Indian languages.We further propose ArogyaSutra, an actor–critic–based multi-agent framework that combines tool grounding with dual-memory mechanisms to support stepwise, reasoning-aware decision making while explicitly retaining past mistakes to prevent their repeated occurrence.
